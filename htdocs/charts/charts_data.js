But only after allowing them to be open for one day so everyone could infect each other &amp; take the virus home to their older relatives. This is scandalously bad government.",

            "RT @theAliceRoberts: Yesterday, Boris Johnson spoke to Andrew Marr saying that scientists had told him schools were very, very, very safe.

            "RT @zarahsultana: Boris Johnson, yesterday: “I am absolutely sure schools are safe.”  Boris Johnson, this evening: “Schools are vectors of transmission.”  The science didn’t change overnight.
